**Use Case**: Change Drawing Color with Number Keys

**Primary Actor**: user

**Goal in Context**: to change the drawing color by pressing number keys 1 through 8, each corresponding to a specific color.

**Preconditions**: The graphics program must be running and in a responsive state.

**Trigger**: The user presses number keys 1 through 8 to select a drawing color.

**Scenario**: 1. The user presses one of the number keys from 1 to 8, corresponding to a specific color choice (as described in the use case description). 2. The application detects the key press and interprets it as a request to change the drawing color. 3. The application changes the current drawing color to the one associated with the pressed number key. 4. The user can now start drawing on the canvas using the newly selected color. 5. If the user wishes to change the color again, they repeat steps 1 to 3 by pressing another number key from 1 to 8.

**Exceptions**: When the user presses a key that is not in the range of 1 to 8 or if they press an invalid key, the application should ignore the input or provide feedback that the input is not recognized.

**Priority**: medium

**When available**: first release
